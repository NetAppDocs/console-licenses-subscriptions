You can view contract details for each of your on-premises ONTAP clusters in the Console. If you have not discovered a cluster, you can also discover them.

.Before you begin

The Console displays details about on-premises ONTAP clusters that you discovered as systems or that are associated with a NetApp Support Site account that you added to the Console.

== View cluster information and contract details

View the status of the hardware and software contracts for your on-premises ONTAP clusters so that you can renew them before they expire. 


.Steps

. From the NetApp Console menu, select *Administration > Licenses and subscriptions*.

. Select *On-Premises ONTAP*.
+
The Software Contract and Hardware Contract expiration dates appear on the line for each cluster.
+
If you are prompted to enter your NetApp Support Site (NSS) account credentials first, select *Add NSS Account*. After you add the account, the clusters associated with that NSS account appear.

. If the contract is close to the expiration date or has expired, you can select the chat icon in the lower-right of the Console to request an extension to the contract.

. To view more details, select image:button_down_caret.png[A down-caret icon] to expand the cluster information.


== Discover clusters

If you have not discovered an on-premises ONTAP cluster as a system, you can do that from the Console. After it is discovered, a cluster is available as a system so that you can manage it.


.Before you begin

You should understand your discovery and management options (discovery using a Console agent or direct discovery without an agent) as well as discovery requirements.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-ontap-onprem/task-discovering-ontap.html[Learn about discovery options and requirements^].


.Steps

. From the NetApp Console menu, select *Administration > Licenses and subscriptions*.

. Select *On-Premises ONTAP*.
+
Your ONTAP clusters display with a status of whether they have been discovered in the Console.
+
If you are prompted to enter your NetApp Support Site (NSS) account credentials first, select *Add NSS Account*. After you add the account, the clusters associated with that NSS account appear.

. Select *Discover* for the cluster that you want to manage through the Console.

. On the _Discover ONTAP Cluster_ page, enter the password for the admin user account and select *Discover*.

NOTE: The cluster management IP address is populated based on information from your NetApp Support Site account.


.Result

The Console discovers the cluster and adds it as a system to the Systems page. The status for the cluster turns to *Discovered* in the _On-Premises ONTAP_ page. Note that the system name is the name of the cluster.

You can now start managing the cluster.
