[.lead]
Billing preferences determine how you handle payments, invoices, and renewal behavior for your organization’s active licenses and subscriptions. 
You can apply these preferences globally, so they affect all billing relationships within your organization, or at the individual subscription level when a specific contract requires its own configuration.

Each billing source in the interface is labeled to clarify its origin: 

- *Marketplace subscriptions* correspond to cloud marketplace contracts (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) where usage charges flow through a hyperscaler account.  
- *Direct licenses* represent licenses purchased directly from NetApp, managed in NetApp Console through license keys, invoice recipients, and renewal options.  
- *Keystone subscriptions* are managed under your Keystone agreement, where invoice recipients and cost center tags are handled through the same interface.

You can mix and match how your organization allocates and pays for services depending on your procurement model.

== Permissions
Only users with the *Account Admin* or *Billing Admin* role can modify billing preferences. These roles ensure that only authorized users can change invoice contacts, cost centers, or renewal settings that affect the organization’s billing data.  
Users with the *Operator* role can view existing preferences but do not have permission to edit them.

== Billing preferences

Billing preferences ensure that usage charges and renewals are applied correctly. Configuring them properly reduces billing disputes and makes it easier to manage hybrid licensing models that combine NetApp-owned and marketplace-purchased capacity.

For example, global billing preferences can unify your invoice contact list so all services share a single billing administrator. You can also use cost center tags to align usage across departments or regions, and enable automatic renewal to prevent service interruptions.  
New Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO) deployments automatically inherit the billing mode you define here, which keeps your organization’s chargeback model consistent as new systems are added.

Billing preferences are configured in the *Licenses and subscriptions* section of NetApp Console.  

From there, you can:

== Fields

Billing fields store metadata about how each license or subscription is billed.  
They describe who is billed, how renewals occur, and which account or cost center each service belongs to.  
The exact set of fields varies depending on whether the billing source is NetApp, a cloud marketplace, or a Keystone agreement.  
These values appear automatically in reports, exports, and through the NetApp Console API.

=== Common fields

Every billing record includes several key attributes that define ownership and renewal behavior:

- *Invoice contacts* — Identify the people who receive invoices and payment reminders for this license or subscription.  
  Typically, these are finance or procurement contacts responsible for billing oversight.

- *Notification contacts* — Specify who receives alerts about license thresholds, capacity usage, or upcoming renewals.  
  This helps ensure that both administrators and stakeholders stay informed about service changes.

- *Cost center or tag* — Provide an internal label, such as `CC-APAC-042`, to associate the billing record with a department, project, or budget line.  
  These tags appear in billing exports and API responses, making it easier to map consumption to internal accounting codes.

- *Auto-renewal* — Determines whether the license or subscription renews automatically before its expiration date.  
  Enabling auto-renewal helps prevent service interruptions, particularly in continuous production environments.

- *Billing currency* — Displays the currency associated with the billing account (for example, USD, EUR, or GBP).  
  This field is read-only and based on the regional settings of the billing provider.

=== Marketplace fields

Marketplace fields describe contracts that originate from a cloud provider such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.  
These fields define how NetApp Console connects your subscriptions with the billing information stored in the provider’s marketplace.  
They also control how renewals, regional assignments, and billing accounts are managed.

- *Marketplace provider* — Identifies the cloud platform where billing is handled.  
  The provider determines the supported features, contract types, and renewal rules.  
  For example, AWS Marketplace subscriptions use account-based billing, while Azure may support both account and tenant-based models.

- *Billing account or subscription ID* — Specifies the unique identifier for the account used to process charges.  
  This ensures that usage data is billed to the correct cloud billing profile.  
  It’s often prefilled from the linked marketplace integration and cannot be changed manually once associated.

- *Contract term* — Defines the subscription duration and renewal settings.  
  Terms can be monthly, annual, or multi-year depending on provider options.  
  Longer commitments may include price advantages but are less flexible than PAYGO models.

- *Region* — Indicates the region in which the contract was established or anchored.  
  In most cases, this field is read-only and inherited from the cloud marketplace itself.  
  The region helps align billing data with the geographical scope of your deployed services.


=== Direct license fields

Direct license fields apply to NetApp-managed contracts purchased directly rather than through a cloud marketplace.  
They define how NetApp invoices you, where the charges are sent, and what legal entity appears on the invoice.  
These fields are critical for organizations using purchase orders or centralized corporate billing.

- *Payment method* — Indicates whether billing occurs through a purchase order, credit card, or other direct mechanism.  
  The available options depend on your organization’s NetApp billing arrangement and currency region.

- *Company legal entity* — Shows the registered legal name that appears on official invoices.  
  This name is important for tax and compliance reporting, especially in multinational organizations.

- *Tax identifiers* — Optional fields that store VAT, GST, or other tax registration numbers.  
  These identifiers ensure that invoices comply with local tax regulations and can be reconciled in corporate accounting systems.


=== Keystone fields

Keystone fields apply to usage that falls under a NetApp Keystone subscription agreement.  
They allow you to connect metered service usage to your Keystone billing profile, aligning subscription data with other capacity-based licensing models.

- *Agreement ID* — A unique identifier for the Keystone contract.  
  It links the billing record in NetApp Console with your Keystone agreement and allows synchronization of usage reporting.

- *Service scope* — Lists the services or capacity pools that fall under the Keystone agreement.  
  This field clarifies which workloads or deployments are included in the contract and ensures that only eligible resources are billed through Keystone.


== Billing options and definitions

Billing options define how NetApp Console prioritizes and applies usage charges when multiple billing sources are connected.  
They control which account is charged first and how billing switches between NetApp licenses and marketplace subscriptions when capacity limits are reached.

=== Terms and options

You can choose between billing modes depending on your organization’s procurement strategy:

- *NetApp licenses first* — Prioritizes billing through active NetApp licenses.  
  When capacity from these licenses is exhausted, usage automatically rolls over to the linked marketplace subscription.

- *Marketplace subscriptions only* — Directs all billing through marketplace contracts, bypassing NetApp licenses.  
  This is common for organizations that standardize procurement through cloud provider billing.

- *PAYGO (Pay-As-You-Go)* — Bills only for actual usage.  
  This model offers the greatest flexibility and requires no upfront commitment, though per-unit pricing may be higher.

- *Annual contract* — Locks in a defined subscription term (typically 12, 24, or 36 months).  
  Annual contracts provide predictable costs and may offer discounted rates in exchange for commitment.

- *Auto-renew* — Enables seamless continuation of licenses or marketplace contracts when they expire.  
  Disabling this option requires manual renewal to prevent service interruption.

- *Custom CVO configuration* — Allows mapping multiple marketplace subscriptions to a single hyperscaler.  
  This is particularly useful when different business units or projects require distinct billing accounts within the same cloud environment.

- *Confirm changes dialog* — Appears before applying billing updates, allowing administrators to review and confirm modifications.  
  This safeguard helps prevent accidental configuration changes that could redirect charges to the wrong account.


=== Typical configuration paths

The following examples illustrate how different billing setups align with common business needs:

|===
| Scenario | Recommended billing option

| Your organization purchased NetApp capacity directly | *NetApp licenses first*
| All usage is billed through marketplace contracts | *Marketplace subscriptions only*
| You bill multiple projects under one cloud provider | *Enable Custom CVO configuration*
| You want to revert to a simple single-source billing setup | *Disable Custom CVO configuration*
|===


For instance, consider an organization that combines both direct NetApp licenses and marketplace subscriptions.  
A typical configuration would set *NetApp licenses first* as the default billing mode to use prepaid capacity before marketplace billing.  
Then, under *Custom CVO configuration*, each hyperscaler (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) would be assigned its corresponding subscription ID.  
Enabling *auto-renewal* ensures that contracts continue without interruption, simplifying lifecycle management and forecasting.

After saving these settings, administrators can review the mappings under *Licenses and subscriptions* to verify that each service points to the correct account.  
For additional validation, they can compare usage data in NetApp Console against cloud billing dashboards and adjust cost center tags or contacts as needed to maintain reporting consistency.
