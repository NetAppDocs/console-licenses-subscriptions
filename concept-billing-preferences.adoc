Billing preferences control how NetApp Console handles payments, invoices, and renewal behavior for your licenses and subscriptions. You set preferences at one of two levels:

* *Global* — applies across direct licenses, marketplace subscriptions, and Keystone subscriptions.
* *Per subscription* — applies only to a specific marketplace or direct license contract.

The UI labels reflect the source of billing:

* *Marketplace subscriptions* — Billing occurs through AWS Marketplace, Azure Marketplace, or Google Cloud Marketplace. You can choose the billing account, region, and renewal options provided by the cloud marketplace.
* *Direct licenses* — Billing occurs through NetApp. You manage license keys, invoice contacts, and auto-renewal in NetApp Console.
* *Keystone subscriptions* — Billing occurs through your Keystone agreement. You manage invoice recipients and cost center tags in NetApp Console.

== Permissions
You need the *Account Admin* or *Billing Admin* role to change billing preferences. Operators can view preferences but cannot modify them.

== Why set billing preferences?
Billing preferences let you:
* enforce a single invoice contact list across services,
* align usage to cost centers,
* manage auto-renewal and expiry notifications,
* ensure new Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO) systems inherit the correct billing account.
