License information automatically displays in the **Licenses and subscriptions** section when the NetApp Console account associated with the license is also a NetApp Support Site account and has internet access. If you used a Console account that is not associated with your NSS account, you'll need to manually add a license. 

You can add the license in the Console either by entering the serial number and the associated NSS account, or by uploading the NetApp license file (NLF). You should obtain a NetApp license file to upload if the Console does not have internet access (private mode installations).

After you purchase a license from your NetApp sales representative, NetApp sends you an email with the serial number and additional licensing details. You'll need that serial number to add or update the respective license in the Console.

NOTE: To enter the serial number, first https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/task-adding-nss-accounts.html[add your NetApp Support Site account to the Console^]. This is the NetApp Support Site account that is authorized to access the serial number.
