== Authorize your account

Before you can use and manage Keystone subscriptions in the Console, you need to contact NetApp to authorize your Console account with your Keystone subscriptions.

. Select *Keystone Subscriptions*.

. If you see the *Welcome to NetApp Keystone* page, send an email to the address listed on the page.

A NetApp representative will process your request by authorizing your account to access the subscriptions.

. Come back to the *Keystone Subscriptions* tab to view your subscriptions.

== Monitor usage

The Digital Advisor dashboard enables you to monitor Keystone subscription usage and generate reports.
