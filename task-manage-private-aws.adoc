Accept a Marketplace private offer for the NetApp Console in the AWS console and configure AWS credentials in the Console.

.Before you begin

* Work with NetApp sales to create a private offer and obtain the activation link.  
* Ensure you have the required AWS Marketplace permissions:  
** link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/buyer-private-offers-subscribing.html[Viewing and subscribing to a private offer]  
** link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/buyer-iam-users-groups-policies.html[Buyer permissions validation]

== Accept the private offer in the AWS console

Completing the subscription assignment in the Console is required to activate the purchase and apply discounted pricing.  

[NOTE]
====
You must complete all steps to activate your private offer. Skipping steps may result in billing errors.  
Accepting and activating the offer multiple times results in double charging.  
====

.Steps
. Click the private offer activation link from your NetApp sales team.  
   The link should look similar to the following:  
   `https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/saas/ordering?productId=aaa&offerId=offer-aaa` 

   If you did not receive the link, view private offers in the AWS Marketplace console. The following permissions are required:  

   * Using AWS managed policies: *AWSMarketplaceRead-only*, *AWSMarketplaceManageSubscriptions*, or *AWSMarketplaceFullAccess*  
   * Using custom IAM policies: `aws-marketplace:ListPrivateListings` and `aws-marketplace:ViewSubscriptions`  

. You are redirected to AWS Marketplace to view the private offer.  
+
[NOTE]
====
Private offers are created on top of public listings. Use the *Offer selection* dropdown to switch between public and private offers.  
====

. Review the private offer details and confirm they match your agreement. If they are incorrect, do not accept. Contact your NetApp account team.  
+
[NOTE]
====
Two types of private offers exist:  

* *On-demand usage*  
** Pricing information  
** Legal terms  

* *Contract*  
** Duration and dates  
** Renewal settings  
** Contract options  
** Total contract price  

For contract offers, enter the number of units agreed upon. For Cloud Volumes ONTAP, ensure you select the correct license before subscribing.  
====

. To accept the private offer, do the following:  
.. For on-demand usage, click *Subscribe*.  
.. For contract offers, enter the number of units for each service and click *Create contract*.  

. After acceptance, a banner confirms the subscription and provides registration instructions.  

. Click *Set up your account*. This redirects to the NetApp Console to configure the subscription.  
+
[NOTE]
====
If you accepted the offer but did not complete registration, return to the product page.  
For contract listings, click *View purchase options* to display the offer, then select *Set up your account*.  
====

. Sign in at https://console.netapp.com with your Console account.  

. After logging in, navigate to https://console.netapp.com/licenses/overview. You are prompted to:  
.. Enter a *Display name* for the Marketplace subscription.  
.. Select the Console *Accounts* with access to the subscription.  
.. [Optional] Enable *Replace existing subscription* to overwrite an existing subscription for one account.  
+
[NOTE]
====
- Replacement applies only to one Console account.  
- To associate multiple accounts with the same subscription, configure additional accounts manually.  
- If credentials were never associated with a subscription, associate them manually as described in the next section.  
====

. Click *Associate* and then *Done*.  

[IMPORTANT]
====
Completing the subscription assignment in the Console is necessary to apply discounted pricing.  
====

== Configure the subscription with AWS credentials

. In the Console, go to *Governance > Licenses and subscriptions* and select the *Marketplace subscriptions* tab.  

. Locate the subscription created earlier. Expand the row to confirm it is associated with your Console account.  
+
[NOTE]
====
Due to AWS Marketplace limitations, some details of private offers are not exposed outside the AWS console. If a field displays `N/A`, check the information directly in the AWS console.  
====

. Click the three-dot menu next to the subscription and select *Configure*.  

. Select the appropriate *AWS account credential* and click *Configure*.  

[NOTE]
====
Marketplace charges for these credentials are billed using the Marketplace subscription. For annual contracts, costs count against the contract usage.  
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Repeat steps 1â€“4 for each AWS credential in your Console account that you want to associate with the subscription.  

- For credentials in other Console organizations, use the *Organization* dropdown and repeat the steps.  
- For credentials in other agents, use the *Agent* dropdown and repeat the steps.
