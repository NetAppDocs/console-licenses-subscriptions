You can configure and manage billing preferences in the NetApp Console to control how capacity usage, renewals, and invoices are applied to your organization’s accounts.  
Billing preferences determine whether usage charges come from NetApp licenses, cloud marketplace contracts, or Keystone agreements.

.Before you begin

- You have access to the *Admin* role.
- All relevant marketplace subscriptions are linked to your organization.
- You reviewed the existing configuration for *licenses and subscriptions*.

== Set billing preferences

You can select how the Console applies usage charges across billing sources. This determines which accounts are charged first and how renewals are handled.

.Steps

. In NetApp Console, select *Administration > Licenses and subscriptions*.
. Select *Billing preferences*.
. Choose one of the following billing modes:
+
** *NetApp licenses first* – Use NetApp licenses first, then marketplace subscriptions for additional usage.
** *Marketplace subscriptions only* – Bill all usage directly through marketplace subscriptions.
+
. Under *Marketplace subscriptions*, select the subscription for each hyperscaler (AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud).
. If you use multiple subscriptions under a single hyperscaler, enable *Custom CVO configuration*.
. (Optional) Update *Invoice contacts* and *Notification contacts*.
. (Optional) Enter a *Cost center tag* to associate billing with internal accounting codes.
. Select *Save changes*.
. When prompted, review the confirmation dialog and select *Confirm*.

.Result

NetApp Console updates the billing mappings. Future service charges and renewals now use the selected configuration.

NOTE: Changing the billing mode redistributes how service charges are applied. New Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO) instances automatically inherit the selected configuration.


== Enable custom CVO configuration

Custom CVO configuration allows you to assign multiple marketplace subscriptions under the same hyperscaler.  
Use this mode if your organization maintains different billing accounts for separate business units or environments.

.Steps

. In NetApp Console, select *Administration > Licenses and subscriptions*.
. Select *Billing preferences*.
. Under **Marketplace subscripitions**, enable *Custom CVO configuration*.
. Select **Save changes**.

.Result

You can now assign specific marketplace subscriptions to individual Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances under the same hyperscaler.

WARNING: After this is enabled, custom CVO configuration cannot be reverted from the **Billing preferences**. Disabling this resets all CVO billing to the standard billing configuration for your data services.


== Edit marketplace configuration

You can edit marketplace configuration details to associate subscriptions with cloud projects or to update contract information.

.Steps

. Open *Licenses and subscriptions*.
. Select *Billing preferences*.
. Select the view for the following:
+
** *Marketplace subscription name*
** *Cloud project*
** *Subscription type* (Annual or PAYGO)
+
. Select *Save changes*.

.Result

The new configuration takes effect immediately, and billing data synchronizes with the cloud provider.

TIP: To map one subscription to multiple cloud projects, ensure that *Custom CVO configuration* is enabled first.


== Confirm or revert billing changes

Every update to billing preferences requires confirmation to prevent accidental changes.

.Confirm changes

. After editing billing preferences, select *Save changes*.
. Review the summary in the confirmation dialog.
. Select *Save* to apply updates, or *Cancel* to discard them.

.Revert to standard billing

. Open *Billing preferences*.
. Disable *Custom CVO configuration*.
. When prompted, confirm that you want to revert to the standard configuration.

.Result

CVO instances return to the default standard billing method used for the other data services.
