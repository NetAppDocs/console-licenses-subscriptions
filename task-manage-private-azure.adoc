Accept and subscribe to a Marketplace private offer for the NetApp Console in the Azure portal. Configure Azure credentials in the Console.

.Before you begin

* Work with NetApp sales to create a private offer for your Azure Billing ID.  
* You have the required permissions to accept a private offer in the Azure Marketplace:
** Enterprise Agreement (EA): *Enterprise administrator*  
** Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA): *Billing account owner* or *Billing account contributor*  
* You must have the required permissions to purchase a private offer in the Azure Marketplace and create a subscription:
** *Subscription owner* or *Subscription contributor* of the Azure subscription being used  
* A single individual can both accept and purchase the private offer if they have the necessary permissions.  

== Accept and subscribe to the private offer in the Azure portal

An Azure subscription can be associated with only one Marketplace subscription.  
If you want to use two different Marketplace subscriptions for workloads in the same Azure subscription, you must create two separate Console accounts—one for each subscription.  
If you have multiple Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances and want to split billing across different subscriptions, create separate Console accounts for each subscription.  

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must complete all steps to accept and activate your private offer. Skipping steps may result in activation issues or double charging.  

If you notice discrepancies in the offer terms, pricing, or details, or if you are unsure which offer to accept, do not accept the offer. Contact your NetApp sales team.  

Accepting and activating the offer multiple times results in double charging.  
====

.Steps
. Click the private offer link provided by your NetApp sales team and sign in.  
  If no link is available, sign in directly to the Azure portal.  

. Search or select *Marketplace* from the Azure services.

. Click *View + accept* to review the details of the private offer.

. Click *Purchase* to complete the purchasing process.

[NOTE]
====

.. Select the *Azure subscription* to use.

== Configure the subscription with Azure credentials

. In the Console, go to *Governance > Licenses and subscriptions* and select the *Marketplace subscriptions* tab.  
. Validate the subscription details:  
.. Locate the Marketplace subscription you created.

. Click the *three-dot menu* next to the subscription and select *Configure*.  
. Select the appropriate *Azure subscription* and click *Configure*.  

The Marketplace charges for this Azure credential are now billed through the Marketplace subscription. For Annual Contracts, usage for this credential counts against the annual contract.  

[IMPORTANT]
====
Repeat Steps 1–4 for each Azure credential in your Console account that you want to associate with the subscription.  

* To associate credentials from another Console organization, use the *Organization* dropdown to switch organizations and repeat the steps.  
* To associate credentials from another agent, use the *Agent* dropdown to switch and repeat the steps.
