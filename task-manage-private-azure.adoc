Accept and subscribe to a Marketplace private offer for the NetApp Console in the Azure portal. Configure Azure credentials in the Console.

.Before you begin

* Work with NetApp sales to create a private offer for your Azure Billing ID.  
* You have the required permissions to accept a private offer in the Azure Marketplace:
** Enterprise Agreement (EA): *Enterprise administrator*  
** Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA): *Billing account owner* or *Billing account contributor*  
* You must have the required permissions to purchase a private offer in the Azure Marketplace and create a subscription:
** *Subscription owner* or *Subscription contributor* of the Azure subscription being used  
* A single individual can both accept and purchase the private offer if they have the necessary permissions.  

== Accept and subscribe to the private offer in the Azure portal

An Azure subscription can be associated with only one Marketplace subscription.  
If you want to use two different Marketplace subscriptions for workloads in the same Azure subscription, you must create two separate Console accounts—one for each subscription.  
If you have multiple Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances and want to split billing across different subscriptions, create separate Console accounts for each subscription.  

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must complete all steps to accept and activate your private offer. Skipping steps may result in activation issues or double charging.  

If you notice discrepancies in the offer terms, pricing, or details, or if you are unsure which offer to accept, do not accept the offer. Contact your NetApp sales team.  

Accepting and activating the offer multiple times results in double charging.  
====
